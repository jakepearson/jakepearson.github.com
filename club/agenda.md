# Programming

## What is programming?
* Giving instructions to computers
* Always follow instructions even if they are a bad idea
* Anyone know a programmer? Anyone work on computers?

## 1st Activity - “Program the Teacher”
The instructor will ask kids to take turns giving instructions to an appointed adult to walk to a place in the room and pick up an object off the floor. In the first attempt the adult will act like a person and avoid walls and generally make it easy for the kids to give instructions. For the second attempt, the adult will be instructed to act like a computer. We will do this by blindfolding the “computer”. That might mean walking into a wall, or picking something off the floor that isn’t there.

## 2nd Activity - “Programming the Kids”
Kids will now break up into as many groups as we have helpers for. One kid will be chosen as the computer. The rest will be the programmers who define a set of instructions for the “computer” to follow. The goal will be same as the previous activity except this time the “programmers” will make up the instructions in advance. They will get a stack of instruction cards with words on them like: forward, turn left, turn right, grab, etc. They will then figure out the program they want the “computer” to follow and read off the list the “computer” to follow.
