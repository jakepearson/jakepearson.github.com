3. This mix may be contained and stored for up to 3 months in the refrigerator.

###For the Cake:
5. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
6. Spray a large Bundt pan (12 cup) with nonstick cooking spray.
7. Sprinkle the chopped walnuts on the bottom.
8. Place Basic Cake Mix, pudding mix, milk, eggs, rum, oil, and vanilla extract in a large bowl and combine on medium speed with electric mixer for 2 to 3 minutes, scrape down the bowl halfway through.

13. Rum Soaking Glaze:.
14. Combine butter, water and sugar in a small saucepan.
15. Bring to a boil carefully as mixture boils over very easily.
16. Reduce to a simmer and cook until sugar is dissolved and syrup is well combined and a little thicker.
17. Remove from the heat and add the rum, mix to combine.
18. While cake is still cooling, pour some of the hot syrup on top of the cake, allowing it time to soak in (this may take a few minutes as there will be a lot of syrup) continue to add syrup until all of the syrup is added.
19. Allow cake to cool completerly in pan before turning out onto serving platter.
20. This cake is delicate, so once it is turned out, it can not be moved around easily.
