Smoke some salmon. I guess you could grill it too. Make some sauce:

* 8 ounces sour cream
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 2 Tablespoons red onion, finely chopped
* 1 whole chipotle chile in adobo sauce (canned), seeded and chopped
* 1 teaspoon adobo sauce (from the can)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1 Tablespoon fresh cilantro, chopped
* 1 Tablespoon lime juice, freshly squeezed

Serve salmon on a bed of avocado slices. Add some thin strips of jalapeno pepper on top. Sauce on the side.
