# Ingredients

* 2 cups cooked chickpeas
* giant handful of chopped cilantro
* 3 tablespoons tahini paste
* zest and juice of one small lemon
* pinch of red pepper flakes
* 1/2 cup crumbled sheep's milk feta
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* fresh ground pepper
* 1 small red onion, very thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
* 2 carrots, thinly peeled with a peeler
* 3 cups sprouts of greens of choice
* extra virgin olive oil
* sriracha for spice, if needed

# Directions

Rinse and drain the chickpeas. In a food processor, give the beans and cilantro a few quick pulses JUST to rough them up, you don't want a paste. I'm talking like 2 to 3 pulses. Transfer to a mixing bowl and add the tahini, lemon juice and zest, pinch of red pepper flakes, feta, olive oil and lots of fresh ground pepper. Stir to blend. Add a tiny splash of water if it looks too dry.

Combine the onion and vinegar in a bowl with a pinch of salt and toss with your fingers to coat just to soften them a bit. Set up your space with the carrots ribbons, vinegared onions and greens. Make each sandwich with a hearty swipe of the chickpea mash, a generous layer of onions, carrots, greens. Drizzle the vegetables with a bit of olive oil and your hot sauce on the side as needed.
