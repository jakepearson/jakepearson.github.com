# Ingredients

* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 large onion, chopped
* large piece ginger, grated
* 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* ½ tsp turmeric
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp curry powder, or to taste
* 227g can chopped tomatoes
* ½ tsp sugar
* 1 cauliflower, cut into florets
* 2 potatoes, cut into chunks
* 1 small green chili, halved lengthways
* squeeze lemon juice
* handful cilantro, roughly chopped, to serve

# Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a saucepan. Cook the onion for 10 mins until soft, then add the ginger, garlic, turmeric, cumin and curry powder. Cook for 1 min more. Stir in the tomatoes and sugar. Add the cauliflower, potatoes and split chili, seasoning to taste. Cover with a lid and gently cook for a good 30 mins, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender – add a drop of water if you need to, but it is meant to be a dry curry.
2. When the vegetables are cooked, remove the chilli, if you like, stir in a squeeze of lemon juice and scatter with coriander. Serve with your choice of Indian bread and a dollop of yogurt.
