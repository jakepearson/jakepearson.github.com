# Ingredients

* 1 (.5-ounce) package dried mushrooms (preferably shiitake but any kind will work)
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil (or 2 tablespoon vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon sesame oil)
* 1 bunch scallions, chopped, whites and greens divided
* 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 8 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, cleaned and sliced (about 4 cups)
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons white miso paste
* 2 packages instant ramen noodles, flavor packets discarded
* 2-3 ounces fresh baby spinach (about 2 cups)
* 4 soft cooked eggs (see note)
* Sriracha (optional)

# Instructions

1. Put the dried mushrooms in large bowl and cover with 4 cups of hot water. Set aside for 15 to 20 minutes until the mushrooms have softened. Strain the mixture, reserving the liquid (be sure to avoid any grit at the bottom of the bowl). Coarsely chop the mushrooms.
2. Combine 2 tablespoons of oil (1 tablespoon vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon sesame oil, if using) scallion whites, ginger, and garlic in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch. Heat over medium heat until sizzling and aromatic, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, the reconstituted mushrooms, and the fresh mushrooms and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms have softened and released their liquid, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the mushroom soaking liquid, 2 cups of water, and the soy sauce and bring to a simmer. Ladle a little bit of the broth into a bowl and stir in the miso paste until well combined. Pour the miso mixture back into the pot and stir to combine. Add the ramen noodles and cook until tender, about 3 minutes.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and add the spinach. Cover and let stand until wilted, about 2 minutes. If you would prefer more broth, add another cup of water. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with and egg, a sprinkle of the scallion greens, and sriracha (if using).

## Bonus Egg Recipe
To make a six-minute egg for ramen, bring a pot of water to a boil. Carefully add an egg and cook for exactly six minutes. Remove the egg with a slotted spoon and transfer it to an ice bath. Cool completely. Very carefully peel the egg and slice it in half with a sharp knife.
