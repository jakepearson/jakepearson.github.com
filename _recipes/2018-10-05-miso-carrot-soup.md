# Ingredients

* 2	pounds carrots, peeled and chopped into 1-inch chunks
* 1	pound celery, chopped into 1-inch chunks
* 1	pound yellow onions, halved, peeled, and cut into 1-inch chunks
* 3	tablespoons canola oil, divided
* 1 1/2	teaspoons kosher salt, divided
* 1/4	cup mellow white miso, divided

# Instructions

1. Heat the oven to 425°F. Line two sheet trays with silicone mats or parchment. 
1. Add the carrots to one tray. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Toss with your hands. Add the celery and onion to another tray. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Toss with your hands. 
1. Stick both trays in the oven and roast for about 1 hour total. Every 20 minutes, rotate the trays and stir vegetables to encourage even cooking. 
1. When the vegetables are done remove both trays from the oven. Add about half of each tray to a blender. Add 2 tablespoons miso and 4 1/2 cups water. Blend until completely smooth, then pour into a large pot on the stove. Repeat with the remaining vegetables, remaining 2 tablespoons miso, and another 4 1/2 cups water—blended until smooth, poured into the pot. 
1. Season the soup with salt, if necessary. Thin with more water, if necessary, depending on how thick you like your soup. Warm over medium-low heat, stirring often, until it’s the temperature you like to eat your soup. Pour into a bowl and serve.
