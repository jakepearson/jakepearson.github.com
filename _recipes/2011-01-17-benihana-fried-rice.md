* 1/2 tsp chopped onion
* 1/3 tsp chopped carrots
* 1/3 tsp chopped green onion
* 4 ounces steamed rice (I do this as one cup of dried rice per person)
* 3 pinches of salt
* 7 tsp butter (this is currently about 1 tbsp)
* 1 egg
* 1/2 tsp oil
* 1 ounce cooked chicken
* 1/4 tsp sesame seeds
* 3 pinches of pepper
* 1 tsp soy sauce

Scramble eggs and chop after cooking.  Saute chopped onion, green onion, and carrots until done and mix with egg and chicken.  Add sesame seed and salt and pepper, stirring well.  Add butter and soy sauce into the mixture, stirring well until done. Makes one serving.
