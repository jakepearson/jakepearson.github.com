## Ingredients

### Crust

* 2 cups graham cracker crumbs
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

### Filling

* 2 cups heavy cream
* 1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk, chilled
* 1 6-ounce can frozen lemonade concentrate (do not thaw)

### Topping

* 1 cup blueberries
* 1 cup raspberries
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Make the crust: In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter. Press firmly on the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Bake for 7 minutes; cool completely.

Make the filling: In a cold medium bowl, whip the cream until stiff peaks form. In another bowl, stir together the condensed milk and frozen lemonade. Gently fold the lemonade mixture into the whipped cream. Pour the filling into the crust; freeze overnight.

About an hour before you serve the pie, make the topping: Toss the berries in a medium bowl with the sugar and lemon juice. Set aside until ready to serve.

Let the pie come to room temperature for 10 minutes before cutting. Top each slice with berries.
