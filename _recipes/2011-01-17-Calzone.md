### Dough

* 2 1/2 cup flour
* 2 Tbsp olive oil (if you use vegatable oil it will crap out)
* 1 cup warm water
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 package yeast

In large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add flour, oil, sugar, and salt.  Mix with wooden spoon (we use kitchenaide with dough hook) until dough loses stickiness.  Set aside for 15 minutes.  Cut dough in half, then roll float to about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thickness.  Spread choice of fillings on dough and roll up.  Cook for 15 minutes at 400.  Half way through you can put some button on top so it will get nice and brown.  This recipe is good for 2 people/2 calzones.
