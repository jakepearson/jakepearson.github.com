# Ingredients

* 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the board (if you can get White Lily flour, your biscuits will be even better)
* 1⁄4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 tablespoon baking powder (use one without aluminum)
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt or 1 teaspoon salt
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, very cold
* 1 cup buttermilk (approx)

# Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 450°F.
2. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, or in the bowl of a food processor.
3. Cut the butter into chunks and cut into the flour until it resembles course meal.
4. If using a food processor, just pulse a few times until this consistency is achieved.
5. Add the buttermilk and mix JUST until combined.
6. If it appears on the dry side, add a bit more buttermilk. It should be very wet.
7. Turn the dough out onto a floured board.
8. Gently, gently PAT (do NOT roll with a rolling pin) the dough out until it's about 1/2" thick. Fold the dough about 5 times, gently press the dough down to a 1 inch thick.
9. Use a round cutter to cut into rounds.
10. Bake for about 10-12 minutes- the biscuits will be a beautiful light golden brown on top and bottom.
