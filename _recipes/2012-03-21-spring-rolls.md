### Preparation

1. In a bowl soak noodles in very hot water to cover 15 minutes and drain well in a colander. 
1. Reserve half of noodles for another use. 
1. With scissors cut remaining noodles into 3- to 4-inch lengths and in a small bowl toss with vinegar and salt to taste.
1. Cut out and discard ribs from lettuce leaves, halving each leaf.
1. In a shallow baking pan or cake pan soak 2 rounds rice paper in hot water to cover until very pliable, 45 seconds to 1 minute.
1. Carefully spread 1 soaked round on a paper towel, leaving remaining round in water, and blot with paper towels. 
1. Arrange 1 piece of lettuce leaf on bottom half of sheet, leaving a 1-inch border along edge. 
1. Top lettuce with about one fourth of peanuts and about one fourth of noodles, arranging them in a line across lettuce. 
1. Top noodles with one fourth each of scallion, carrot, cabbage, and herbs. Roll up filling tightly in rice paper, folding insides after first roll to completely enclose filling, and continue rolling.
1. Spread remaining soaked rice paper round on paper towel and blot with another paper towel. 
1. Wrap rice paper around spring roll in same manner. 
1. (Double wrapping covers any tears and makes roll more stable and easier to eat.) 
1. Wrap spring roll in rinsed and squeezed paper towel and put in a resealable plastic bag. 
1. Make 3 more rolls with remaining ingredients in same manner. 
1. Rolls may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, wrapped in wet paper towels in sealed plastic bag.
1. Before serving, bring rolls to room temperature.
1. Discard paper towels. Halve rolls diagonally and serve with peanut sauce.
