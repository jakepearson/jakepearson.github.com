## Ingredients

- 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, fruity, more neutral-tasting, plus extra for the pan
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ to 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1 ½ cups plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs
- Grated zest of 2 oranges, plus 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice
- 1 ¼ cups whole milk or plant-based alternative
- 2 tablespoons sifted confectioners’ sugar, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Prepare the oven:
   - Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Prepare the baking pan:
   - Brush the bottom and sides of a 9-inch round cake pan with a little olive oil.
   - Line the bottom of the pan with a round of parchment paper and dust with a bit of the flour, shaking out the excess.
3. Mix together dry ingredients:
   - In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 cups flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.
4. Beat the wet ingredients with sugar:
   - In a large bowl, combine 1 ½ cups granulated sugar, cardamom, and eggs.
   - Using an electric hand mixer set on high, beat the mixture until thick and fluffy, about 5 minutes (or use a stand mixer on high speed).
   - While the mixer is running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil and beat until incorporated.
   - Reduce the speed to low and add half the orange zest, the orange juice, and milk. Beat until smooth.
5. Combine the wet and dry ingredients:
   - Add the flour mixture to wet ingredients and mix on low just until you have a uniform batter.
6. Bake the cake:
   - Pour the cake batter into the pan and sprinkle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar.
   - Bake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the center is set and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean (ovens do vary, so check your cake at 30 minutes and go from there).
7. Cool the cake:
   - Allow the cake to cool for 30 minutes in the pan, then run a small knife around the edge.
   - Invert the cake onto a large plate, then invert again onto a rack to cool completely.
8. Serve:
   - Before serving, dust the cake with powdered sugar and sprinkle with orange zest.
