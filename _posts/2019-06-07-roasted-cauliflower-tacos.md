# Tacos

## Ingredients

* 1 Head of Cauliflower* (see note) chopped into small bite size pieces, about 1 3/4 lb (790g)
* 2 1/2 Tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil divided
* 1 C (110g) Purple Onion chopped, about 1 medium
* 1 tsp Fine Sea Salt
* 1/2 tsp Cumin ground
* 1 1/2 - 2 Tbs Chipotle Chilis + Adobo Sauce mince the chilis and mix with adobo sauce - look for gluten free if needed
* 1 C (274g) Fire Roasted Tomatoes + its juices, leftovers may be frozen
* 1/2 C (135g) Your Favorite Prepared Salsa
* 12-14 6" Corn or Flour Tortillas

## Instructions

1. Set oven rack to center of the oven and preheat to 425F (218C). Line a sheet pan with silpat or parchment paper. 
2. Toss the cauliflower with 1 1/2 Tbs olive oil and roast for 15-20 minutes, tossing and flipping the cauliflower once while roasting. When done, it should still be firm, yet toasty around the edges. Set aside. 
3. While the cauliflower is roasting, heat the remaining 1 Tbs olive oil in a large saute pan until it shimmers. Add the onion and saute on medium low for about 5-8 minutes, or just until softened. Sprinkle in the salt and cumin and add the chipotles + adobo sauce. Stir to coat. Add the tomatoes, salsa and roasted cauliflower. Stir to warm through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and put a lid on it until ready to serve. 

# Chili-Lime Slaw

## Ingredients

* 3 C (150g) Purple and Green Cabbage shredded, loosely packed
* 1 Tbs Fresh Jalapeno seeded and chopped fine, or to taste (add more to take the spicy up!)
* 1/2 C (20g) Cilantro chopped
* Juice of Two Limes
* 1/2 tsp Fine Sea Salt

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, mix the red and green cabbage, jalape√±o, cilantro, lime juice and sea salt. Set aside or rest in the refrigerator until ready for service. 

# To Assemble

1. I like to warm my tortillas on a low open flame on the stove top turning with tongs a few times to lightly char the tortillas. To hold them warm, place the tortillas in foil and into a warmed toaster oven on low heat.
2. On the tortilla, spoon a good smear of guacamole or pepita crema down the center of the tortilla. Spoon the cauliflower mixture evenly over the top, then add the slaw and any condiments you prefer.
3. Store the leftover cauliflower mixture in the fridge in a lidded container for up to three days or it may be frozen for up to a month.
