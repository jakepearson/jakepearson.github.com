## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds butternut squash
- 1 large red onion (12 ounces / 340 grams)
- 2 pounds lacinato kale
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup black lentils
- 1/2 cup slivered almonds (2 ounces / 56 grams)
- 1 cup fresh sage leaves (1 ounce / 28 grams)
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 tablespoon dijon mustard
- 4 ounces sliceable goat cheese (e.g., Humboldt Fog or similar)

## Instructions

1. Equally stagger two racks in the oven and preheat to 425°F.
2. Peel and cube the butternut squash into 1-inch pieces. Thinly slice the red onion. Remove the ribs of the kale and thinly slice it as well.
3. Add the butternut squash and red onion to one baking sheet, and the kale to the other.
4. Drizzle each sheet pan with a tablespoon of olive oil and season each pan with 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and freshly ground black pepper. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of Diamond Crystal kosher salt per pan. Mix to coat evenly.
5. Bake the butternut squash on the bottom rack for 18-20 minutes, or until starting to brown. Mix the squash, then add the kale to the top rack and roast for an additional 8-10 minutes until lightly charred on the edges.
6. While the vegetables are roasting, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Season with 1 teaspoon of Diamond Crystal kosher salt and add the black lentils. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the lentils are tender but slightly al dente, about 20-25 minutes.
7. While the lentils are cooking, heat a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add two tablespoons of olive oil and the almonds. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the almonds begin to brown. Add the sage leaves and let them sizzle in the oil. Cook another 1-2 minutes until the sage darkens slightly but does not brown. Transfer the sage and almonds to a paper towel to drain. Wipe excess oil from the pan.
8. Whisk together the apple cider vinegar, honey, and mustard. Taste and season with salt as needed.
9. When the vegetables are done roasting, combine them on one sheet pan. Drain the lentils and add them as well. Drizzle the vinaigrette over the mixture and toss. Add the crispy sage and almonds.
10. If desired, heat the sauté pan over medium heat. Slice the goat cheese into four pieces. Add them one at a time to the pan and let them griddle, untouched, until melted and golden brown on the bottom. Use a spatula to transfer the griddled cheese directly onto the salad.
11. Serve immediately.
