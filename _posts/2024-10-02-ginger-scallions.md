## Ingredients

- Salt
- 4 baby bok choy (about 12 ounces), each trimmed and quartered lengthwise
- 4 scallions, trimmed, white and green parts thinly sliced and separated
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons rice vinegar
- 1 (2-inch piece) fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped (about ¼ cup)
- ¼ cup neutral oil
- 2 (14- to 16-ounce) blocks of tofu
- Toasted white or black sesame seeds, for serving
- White rice (optional), to serve

## Instructions

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the baby bok choy and cook until the stems are just tender and the leaves are bright green, 1½ to 2 minutes. Rinse under cold water until thoroughly cooled, then drain well.
2. Place the green parts of the scallions into a heatproof bowl and add the soy sauce, sesame oil and rice vinegar.
3. Place the ginger, white parts of the scallions and the neutral oil into a small pot and place on medium-high heat. Stir until the ginger and scallions start to sizzle and become aromatic (watch closely so that they don’t burn), 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately — and carefully — pour this over the green scallion mixture. Stir to combine. Taste and season with salt; it should be quite salty to balance the neutral flavor of the tofu.
4. Carefully drain the liquid from each package of tofu, and gently tip the blocks onto a clean kitchen towel. (Try to keep each block in one piece, but don’t worry if it falls apart.) Pat with another clean kitchen towel, removing as much liquid as possible. Transfer the blocks to one large plate or two smaller plates and cut into 1-inch blocks. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Add the bok choy on top and around the tofu and spoon over the ginger-scallion oil. To serve, top with sesame seeds and eat as is or serve with rice.
