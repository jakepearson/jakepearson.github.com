## Ingredients

- ½ cup / 100 g dried chickpeas
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 2 small cucumbers (10 oz / 280 g in total)
- 2 large tomatoes (10½ oz / 300 g in total)
- 8½ oz / 240 g radishes
- 1 red pepper, seeded and ribs removed
- 1 small red onion, peeled
- ¾ oz / 20 g cilantro leaves and stems, coarsely chopped
- ½ oz / 15 g flat-leaf parsley, coarsely chopped
- 6 tbsp / 90 ml olive oil
- Grated zest of 1 lemon, plus 2 tbsp juice
- 1¾ tbsp sherry vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 1 tsp superfine sugar
- 1 tsp ground cardamom
- 1½ tsp ground allspice
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- Greek yogurt (optional)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Method

1. Soak the dried chickpeas overnight in a large bowl with plenty of cold water and the baking soda. The next day, drain, place in a large saucepan, and cover with water twice the volume of the chickpeas. Bring to a boil and simmer, skimming off any foam, for about an hour, until tender, then drain.

2. Cut the cucumber, tomato, radish, and pepper into ⅝-inch / 1.5 cm dice; cut the onion into ¼-inch / 0.5 cm dice. Mix everything together in a bowl with the cilantro and parsley.

3. In a jar or sealable container, mix 5 tbsp / 75 ml of the olive oil, the lemon juice and zest, vinegar, garlic, and sugar and mix well to form a dressing, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss lightly.

4. Mix together the cardamom, allspice, cumin, and ¼ teaspoon salt and spread on a plate. Toss the cooked chickpeas in the spice mixture in a few batches to coat well. Heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat and lightly fry the chickpeas for 2 to 3 minutes, gently shaking the pan so they cook evenly and don't stick. Keep warm.

5. Divide the salad among four plates, arranging it in a large circle, and spoon the warm spiced chickpeas on top, keeping the edge of the salad clear. You can drizzle some Greek yogurt on top to make the salad creamy.
