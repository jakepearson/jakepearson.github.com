Nothing sparks holiday nostalgia like candy canes, so don’t be surprised if this dessert becomes the thing your family looks forward to year after year. It requires very little effort and can be made days ahead of time. Better still: it speaks to the kid inside each guest, ensuring that your gathering will have a very sweet ending indeed.

* 1 tsp. vegetable oil
* 13 oz. homemade or store-bought brownies
* 3 qts. high-quality vanilla ice cream
* 1 cup crushed peppermint candies
* ¾ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1 cup whipping cream
* 2 tbsp. sugar

Using your fingers, rub the bottom and sides of an 8-inch spring form pan (or 10-inch deep-dish pie pan) evenly with vegetable oil; this will help the frozen pie lift off the pan more easily when serving. Break brownies into bite-size pieces and press evenly into pie pan, covering the bottom and sides flush to the edge. Cover pan and freeze for at least 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, put ice cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment; beat at medium speed until ice cream is smooth and malleable (like taffy), about 1 minute. Add candies and mix just until combined, about 1 minute. Using a spatula, spread ice cream over brownies. Freeze, covered, for at least 6 hours or until ice cream is completely firm.

In a microwave-safe bowl, melt chocolate chips on full power until half-melted. Stir until smooth, adding about ¼ cup of cream to thin. Whip the remaining ¾ cup cream with the sugar until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. With a large knife run under hot water, cut cake into 12 equal slices. Set slices on individual plates (keep any remaining cake covered in the freezer until ready to serve). Dollop whipped cream onto each slice and use a spoon to drizzle warm melted chocolate over the top. Serves 12.
