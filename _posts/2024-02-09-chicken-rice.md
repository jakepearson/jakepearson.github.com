## Ingredients

Might wanna double all the spices

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- 3 garlic cloves chopped fine
- 2 large chicken breasts chopped
- 1 small yellow onion chopped
- 4 cups broccoli roughly chopped
- 1.5 cups jasmine rice
- 2.5 cups white cheddar shredded
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1/3 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp pepper
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp dried parsley
- 1/4 tsp ground mustard
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika

## Directions

1. Begin by chopping your chicken breasts into bite sized pieces. Set aside.
2. Chop your onion, garlic and broccoli. Set aside.
3. In a small bowl, add your spices and mix together. Set aside.
4. To a large pan set to medium heat, add your butter and olive oil. Once heated, add your chicken breasts and spices and sauté for 3-5 minutes, just until the chicken begins to brown.
5. Add your onion and garlic and sauté for another 2-3 minutes, just until the onions are softened.
6. Reduce heat to low and add your rice and chicken stock. Cover with a lid and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the stock is almost absorbed.
   (you can add your broccoli in the same time as your rice and stock if you want it really soft).
7. When the rice has another 3 minutes or so to cook add your broccoli, shredded cheese, and heavy cream. Simmer for the last 3 minutes or until the stock is absorbed, the broccoli has softened and the cheese has been melted.
8. Dish up right away and be sure to sprinkle on lots of fresh cracked pepper.
