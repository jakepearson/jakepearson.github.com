- 1 jalapeño pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced
- 4 ounces diced green chiles
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 4 cups cooked shredded chicken
- 2 cups salsa verde
- 2 (15.5-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (15-ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained and rinsed
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 bay leaf
- ½ cup chopped cilantro
- 4 tablespoons lime juice (about 2 limes)
- **Toppings:** sour cream, diced avocados, sliced green onions, tortilla chips

## Instructions

1. **Cook the Vegetables:**  
   Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion, poblanos, jalapeño, and diced green chiles. Cook for 10 minutes until the peppers are softened and the onions are translucent. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

2. **Add Remaining Ingredients:**  
   Add the chicken broth, shredded chicken, salsa verde, beans, corn, salt, cumin, oregano, and bay leaf. Stir to combine and bring to a boil.

3. **Simmer:**  
   Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Uncover and cook for an additional 10 minutes to reduce the broth.

4. **Garnish and Serve:**  
   Discard the bay leaf and stir in the chopped cilantro and lime juice. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve in bowls topped with sour cream, cilantro, green onions, and avocados.
