## Ingredients

Warning this recipe is super salty (maybe don't let the tomatoes brine for so long)

### For the pie dough

- 2 cups AP flour plus more for dusting
- 1.5 sticks cold butter unsalted, cut into large cubes
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- ⅓ cup ice water plus more as needed
- 2 tsp salt

### For the galette

- 4-6 large heirloom tomatoes preferably varying sizes and colors
- ¼ cup basil pesto
- 2 cups fresh grated parmesan or pecorino
- ¼ cup fresh basil leaves for garnish
- 1 egg beaten, for egg wash
- 1 cup stracciatella or burrata
- 1 lemon zested
- flaky salt and black pepper for serving

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400.
1. Slice your tomatoes to about ¼ of an inch thick. Salt both sides, and transfer to a paper towel lined sheet tray. Allow the tomatoes to release their excess moisture for at least 10 minutes.
1. make the pie dough
1. Combine 2 cups flour, cubed cold butter, and salt to a food processor. Pulse until the butter is about the size of peas. Transfer to a large bowl, and add apple cider vinegar and ⅓ cup ice water. Stir with a fork. Add an additional splash of water until the dough starts to come together.
1. Dust a clean work surface with flour. Transfer the dough to surface and knead until no dry spots remain. Avoid overworking. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
1. Once chilled, transfer the dough to a clean work surface dusted with flour. Roll out into a large circle until the dough is about 1/8 of an inch thick. Carefully transfer to a sheet tray lined with parchment.
1. Build your galette immediately or transfer the dough back to the fridge until you're ready to go.
1. build your galette
1. Spread about ¼ cup of basil pesto in the center of the dough, leaving about 1-2 inches of dough for the crust. Sprinkle 1½ cups of grated parmesan on top of the pesto. Layer the tomatoes on top of the cheese.
1. Fold the crust over the edges of the tomatoes. Brush the exposed crust with egg wash and sprinkle with remaining parmesan. Top everything with flaky salt.
1. Transfer to preheated oven for 45-55 minutes.
1. Allow the galette to cool on the hot sheet tray for about 15 minutes before garnishing and slicing.
1. garnish and serve
1. Once the galette has cooled, top with stracciatella, extra pesto, fresh basil, grated lemon zest, flaky salt, and black pepper. Slice and serve.
