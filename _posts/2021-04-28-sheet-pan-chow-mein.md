## Ingredients

### Main

- 1 bell pepper (any color), finely sliced
- 1 carrot, peeled and finely sliced diagonally
- 1 head of broccoli, cut into florets, or bundle of broccolini, cut into 1- to 2-inch segments
- Kosher salt
- Olive oil or a neutral oil
- A 250-gram or 8.8-ounce package dried thin egg noodles
- 1 small can baby corn, drained
- 6 ounces asparagus, sugar snaps, or snow peas, trimmed and cut into 1- to 2-inch segments
- 1 medium shallot or 3 scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, to finish
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil

### Soy Seasoning

- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce, tamari, or coconut aminos
- 1 tablespoon vegetarian stir-fry sauce, such as vegetarian oyster or hoisin sauce (optional)
- 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 small clove garlic, grated or minced

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 425Â°F. On a large baking sheet, toss the pepper, carrot, and broccoli with a splash of olive oil and season with salt. Roast for 10 minutes, until the vegetables start to soften.
Meanwhile, make the noodles: Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the egg noodles, and cook according to the packet instructions, or al dente, about four to five minutes. Drain and cool under cold running water. Drain well again and pat dry with a clean tea towel.
2. Combine the soy seasoning ingredients in a small bowl.
3. Remove the baking sheet and push the vegetables to the side. Add the noodles, corn and asparagus. Drizzle the noodles with sesame oil, season with more salt and toss well to coat. Return the tray to the oven and bake for another 15 to 18 minutes, until the noodles are crispy on the top and bottom. We are looking for a combination of crispy and non-crispy noodles.
4. Remove the tray from the oven, drizzle over the soy seasoning and toss well. Scatter over the shallot and sesame seeds and serve.
